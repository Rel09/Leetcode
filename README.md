# Leetcode

This is my repo to showcase my Leetcode solutions.

You will find folders named after their problem numbers, organized by language. Inside each folder, there is a `README` explaining the problem and instructions on how to run the solution.

My goal is to add at least 2 new solutions per day.

Enjoy!
